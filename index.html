            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I'm an all year around athelete. I do volleyball in the fall🏐, basketball in the winter🏀, crew during the spring🚣‍♀️. I enjoy cooking new things I see on Tiktok, and I LOVE making a midnight ramen for myself. My sports usually take up big part of my day so I don't usually have time for anything else other than homework and practice. But as I said, I like watching movies and tv shows, especially thriller movies. </p>
